# Claude Instructions for Calorie Planning

## Overview

This folder contains daily calorie planning files for tracking meals and nutrition.

## File Structure

- `1 monday.md` through `5 friday.md` - Daily calorie tracking files
- Files are numbered to sort alphabetically in order
- The same files are maintained each week, but wiped/cleared at the start of each new week

## Planning Process

Referencing the mealplan.md file for the current week, plan out food and calories for the day. Assume that the Monday meal plan dinner is eaten for dinner on Monday night, but leftovers are eaten for lunch on the following day, so on Tuesday.

Use estimated macro nutrients from the meals on the meal plan to recommend portion sizes (in grams) that will help meet the daily calorie and macro targets.

## Calorie and Macro Targets

- **Target calories**: 1850 calories per day (aim for this target)
- **Fat**: No more than 1/3 of total calories (approximately 617 calories or ~69g max)
- **Protein**: At least 100g per day

**Note**: All food weights should be assumed to be cooked/ready-to-eat unless otherwise specified (e.g., "raw" or "uncooked").

## Standard Items

- **Early snack**: Siggi's yogurt or Icelandic Provisions skyr (always)
- **Evening snack**: 15g of dark chocolate chips (can be combined with other items)
- Additional items can be added to late snack and evening snack to help meet calorie and macro targets
- **Avoid having nuts twice in a day** - if nuts are included in late snack, do not include them in evening snack (and vice versa)
- **Avoid having yogurt twice in a day** - since Siggi's yogurt is always included in early snack, do not include Greek yogurt or other yogurt products in other meals

## Meal Structure

The meals tracked are:
- Lunch
- Early snack
- Late snack
- Dinner
- Evening snack

## Table Format

The meal plan should be a table with columns for:
- Meal
- Food
- Carbs (grams)
- Protein (grams)
- Fat (grams)
- Calories

Calories are calculated as: (Carbs × 4) + (Protein × 4) + (Fat × 9)

To make the table more readable:
- Only the first entry for a meal should list the meal name
- Subsequent rows for the same meal should have the meal name blank
- Add meal subtotals for meals with multiple items (if a meal has only one item, do not include a subtotal)
- Meal subtotals should be formatted in bold with leading and trailing dashes (e.g., "-- **Lunch Subtotal** --")

There should be a total row at the bottom of the table showing totals for carbs, protein, fat, and calories.
