# Claude Instructions for Meal Planning

## Meal Prep Strategy

We like preparing meals that create leftovers early in the week, like rice, baked potatoes, roast veggies, etc, that can become staples and used in other meals during the week.

## Focus

Focus on dinner planning only

## Weekly Schedule Considerations

- **Monday and Tuesday**: We have evening activities - plan accordingly
- **Thursday**: We leave the house early at 3:30 pm and aren't home until after 6:30 pm
  - Good day for either very fast meals (like simple pasta aglio olio)
  - OR instant pot / pressure cooker meals that can be made ahead of time

## Meal Planning Process

- Use the mealplan.md file to create a running record of meals and dates, so we don't "fall into a rut" and make the same things over and over.
- If a recipe doesn't appear in the recipes list, but is added via chat to the meal plan, ask to add it to the recipe's list.
- Use concise, comma-separated format for meal descriptions (e.g. "pasta aglio olio, chicken, salad stuff" rather than "pasta aglio olio with precooked chicken and salad stuff").
- We typically try to include a protein and a vegetable with each meal.
- **Avoid quinoa** - we don't like it.

## Print File Format

The print.md file should follow this specific format:

```

## Shopping List

**Produce:**                   **Meat:**                     **Thaw:**
- [item]                       - [item]                      - [item]
- [item]                       - [item]                      - [item]

**Dairy/Frozen:**               **Pantry:**
- [item]                       - [item]
- [item]                       - [item]
```

The shopping list should be organized into these columns (only include columns that have items):
1. **Produce** - fresh vegetables, fruits, herbs
2. **Meat** - fresh meat, seafood, poultry
3. **Thaw** - frozen items to defrost
4. **Dairy/Frozen** - dairy products and frozen items
5. **Pantry** - dry goods, condiments, spices, etc.
